# Called by `local/keys.sh <topology> solana-channels`, which is where every
# topology fact above comes from. This file holds none of them: it opens the
# one channel it is told about and refuses to report success unless the chain
# agrees.
#
# ── Why this goes through the operator surface ───────────────────────────────
#
# The EVM half of a local peering is opened with `cast send`, because a
# TokenNetwork's `openChannel` is an ordinary contract call and Foundry can
# build one from a signature string. Solana has no equivalent: `InitializeChannel`
# is a positional account list plus an 8-byte discriminator
# (`packages/solana-program/src/instruction.rs`), and the Solana CLI cannot
# build an arbitrary program instruction at all. `spl-token` knows only the SPL
# Token program.
#
# So the only thing in this repository that can submit it is the connector
# itself, through `POST /channels` -- ADR 0008's third write, issue #459 --
# which reaches `SolanaSettlementBackend::open` and signs with the node's own
# `[settlement.solana]` key. That is also the right answer rather than merely
# the available one: the channel's on-chain participant IS that settlement
# identity, so the node that will sign claims on the channel is the node that
# opens it, and no second copy of the key has to exist anywhere.
#
# The DEPOSIT goes the same way, and for a stronger version of the same reason.
# `packages/solana-program`'s `Deposit` credits strictly by signer -- there is
# no participant parameter, so nobody can deposit for anyone else (issue #1118)
# -- which means the payer's node is not merely the only available submitter of
# its own collateral, it is the only possible one. `POST /channels/:id/fund`
# reaches `SolanaSettlementBackend::fund`, which since #1118 is that
# self-deposit on both chains.
#
# Opening and funding a channel are therefore the OPERATOR's job here, done
# after the node is serving -- not the connector's at boot. `[[peer_channels]]`
# is a statement about which claims this node will accept, not an instruction
# to go and create something on a chain; ADR 0009's config is read once and
# creates nothing.
#
# ── What this asserts, and why the assertion is the point ────────────────────
#
# A peer claim's verdict never reads the chain (`ClaimBook` checks the
# signature against the configured `counterparty_key` and nothing else,
# CF-23), so a topology whose Solana channel was never opened rehearses
# exactly as green as one whose channel is real. That is the failure this
# script exists to make impossible: after the write, it reads the channel
# account back off the validator and requires the deployed program's own
# layout to agree with the committed config -- the discriminator, both
# participants, the mint, and `Opened` status. Anything else exits non-zero.
#
# The same applies one level down to the collateral, which is why
# `--deposit-base-units` is not simply "post the deposit". A channel funded
# through an endpoint that answered 200 is not a channel holding money; the
# deposit is re-read out of the program's own account afterwards, on the
# payer's own side of it, and a shortfall is a non-zero exit. Nothing here
# trusts the response body it just got.
#
# Idempotent, on both writes and in different ways. A channel already open at
# the expected address is left alone and still asserted. The deposit is a
# TOP-UP: `POST /channels/:id/fund` takes an INCREMENT (unlike the EVM leg's
# absolute `setTotalDeposit`), so this reads what the payer has already put in
# and deposits only the shortfall -- nothing at all when the target is already
# met. Re-running `make local-up`, or `local/keys.sh <topology>
# solana-channels` by hand, therefore moves no money the second time.
